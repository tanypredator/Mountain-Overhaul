  <description>This mod changes visuals of the natural mountains so that each mountain tile is a separate rock. It was inspired by the Minerals_SK mod, which looks great, but includes very complicated mechanics, leading to mod conflicts. In my mod there is no such mechanics that adds a new rock type for the walls of rooms and tunnels cut in the mountain, so they will look the same way as the exterior mountain walls, until you smoothen them.

I've also changed the rock color. Vanilla ores are included too.

Textures were (mostly) made by ChatGPT and refined in GIMP :)
